## Best Practices

<Note>
  Always validate your VCF files using `check_vcf_compatibility` before downstream analysis to ensure format compliance and prevent processing errors.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Index your VCF files with `index_vcf` before performing multiple queries to significantly improve performance.
</Tip>
