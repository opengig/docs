## Overview

This collection of 12 tools handles data conversion between different formats, file processing, and variant filtering operations essential for genomic analysis workflows.

---

## File Preview & Inspection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="first_k_lines_of_csv" icon="eye">
    ### Preview the first K lines of a CSV file
    
    **Usage:** Data preview and structure understanding
    
    **Description:**
    Quickly inspect the structure and first few rows of large CSV files without loading the entire dataset. Useful for understanding column headers, data types, and verifying file integrity before processing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Format Conversion Tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="csv_to_vcf" icon="file-export">
    ### Convert CSV data to VCF format
    
    **Usage:** Format conversion for genomic analysis
    
    **Description:**
    Transform CSV data containing genomic variants into standard VCF (Variant Call Format) files. Enables compatibility with downstream genomic analysis tools and databases that require VCF input.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="convert_xlsx_to_csv" icon="file-excel">
    ### Transform Excel spreadsheets to CSV
    
    **Usage:** Format conversion between delimited files
    
    **Description:**
    Convert Excel files (.xlsx) with multiple sheets to CSV format for easier data processing and integration with command-line tools. Each sheet can be converted separately or combined into a single CSV.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="convert_tsv_to_csv" icon="file-lines">
    ### Convert tab-separated values to comma-separated values
    
    **Usage:** Format conversion between delimited files
    
    **Description:**
    Transform tab-separated files (TSV) into comma-separated files (CSV) for standardization. Essential for tools that expect CSV format while maintaining data integrity through the conversion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="genomic_to_vcf" icon="dna">
    ### Convert genomic data formats to VCF
    
    **Usage:** Standardize genomic file formats
    
    **Description:**
    Convert various genomic data formats (BAM, SAM, PLINK, etc.) into standard VCF format. Enables integration with modern genomic analysis pipelines and population databases.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Creation & Generation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="create_csv_from_data" icon="file-plus">
    ### Generate CSV files from structured data
    
    **Usage:** Create datasets from query results
    
    **Description:**
    Create well-formatted CSV files from structured data sources such as SQL query results, JSON objects, or Python dictionaries. Ideal for exporting analysis results and sharing data in standardized format.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## VCF Operations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="check_vcf_compatibility" icon="circle-check">
    ### Validate VCF file compatibility
    
    **Usage:** File validation and format checking
    
    **Description:**
    Verify VCF file compliance with standard specifications including header format, variant information fields, and sample columns. Identifies and reports format issues before processing with downstream tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="index_vcf" icon="list-ol">
    ### Create index files for VCF datasets
    
    **Usage:** Optimize VCF file access and querying
    
    **Description:**
    Generate tabix or CSI indices for VCF files to enable fast random access and efficient querying of specific genomic regions without scanning the entire file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="convert_ids_in_csv_using_vcf" icon="tag">
    ### Map and convert identifiers using VCF
    
    **Usage:** Identifier mapping and conversion
    
    **Description:**
    Use VCF file information to map and convert identifiers in CSV data, enabling consistent naming across datasets. Supports mapping between different identifier systems (gene names, RSIDs, etc.).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Variant Filtering

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="filter_vcf_by_rsids" icon="filter">
    ### Filter variants by specific RSIDs
    
    **Usage:** Extract relevant variants from VCF
    
    **Description:**
    Extract specific variants from VCF files based on their RSID identifiers. Useful for focusing analysis on known variants of interest or filtering out variants not present in public databases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="filter_vcf_by_genes" icon="magnifying-glass">
    ### Extract variants from specific genes
    
    **Usage:** Gene-based variant filtering
    
    **Description:**
    Filter VCF files to extract variants located within specific genes of interest. Supports both precise gene coordinates and approximate region-based filtering for functional variant analysis.
  </Accordion>
